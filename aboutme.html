                <p>Hi! My name is Ren-Jay Wang (Chinese: 王仁傑) and I am a currently working as a software engineer on the Render Platform team at Wayfair in Boston. As one of the two engineers on this team, I have the exciting responsibilty of maintaining the image rendering pipeline for the millions of images that are used on the Wayfair website. This involves watching performance, keeping track of failures, and trying to optimize the way we use our render queue manager. Before this, I worked as a software engineer at Raytheon. To see details about this and the rest of my professional background, please take a look at my <a href="Ren-Jay Wang Resume.pdf" target="_blank">résumé</a>!</p><br>
                <p>Prior to my professional work, I was a master's student studying Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. My focus was in human computer interaction and computer security. Specifically, I was interested in studying how application interfaces influence their usability and security. I also did my undergraduate years at UIUC, during which I took and excelled in a number of classes, including Web Programming, Computer Security, User Interfaces, Data Structures, Database Systems, and Algorithms and Models of Computation. My favorite class was Programming Studio, which is a class involving intensive programming and learning good coding practices. I was also a teaching assistant for this course during my last year in univeristy. Watching students develop and improve their programming style was very rewarding, and teaching also introduced me to many aspects of programming that I had never considered.</p><br>
                <p>Outside of programming I also have a variety of interests. In college, I was involved in Illini Taekwondo, the Taiwanese Student Club, and had taken leading roles in Intervarsity Christian Fellowship and Christians on Campus. I was also the Co-President for the Japan Intercultural Network from August 2014 to May 2015. Currently, when I am not working I enjoy playing Ultimate Frisbee, soccer, basketball, volleyball and League of Legends. I have also recently enjoyed watching The Office.</p>
