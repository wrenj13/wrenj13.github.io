                <p>Hi! My name is Ren-Jay Wang (Chinese: 王仁傑) and I am a first semester master&apos;s student in Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I am originally from Massachusetts. My focus is in human computer interaction and computer security. Specifically, I am interested in how the application interfaces influence their usability and security. I also did my undergraduate years at UIUC, during which I took and excelled in a number of classes, including Web Programming, Computer Security, User Interfaces, Data Structures, Database Systems, and Algorithms and Models of Computation. My favorite class that I took here is Programming Studio, which is a class involving intensive programming and learning good coding practices. I wrote my <a href="http://web.engr.illinois.edu/~davidfu2/renjay/index.php" target="_blank">Rhythm game</a> in this class. I am currently a teaching assistant for this course, and have previously been a course assistant for Intro to Computer Science and Systems Programming. Want to know specifics? Please take a look at my <a href="Resume Jan 2017.pdf" target="_blank">résumé</a>!</p><br><br>
                <p>Outside of class I also have a variety of interests. I have been involved in Illini Taekwondo and the Taiwanese Student Club, and have taken leading roles in Intervarsity Christian Fellowship and Christians on Campus. I was also the Co-President for the Japan Intercultural Network from August 2014 to May 2015. I enjoy playing Ultimate Frisbee, soccer, basketball, volleyball and League of Legends. I have also recently enjoyed watching The Office.</p>
